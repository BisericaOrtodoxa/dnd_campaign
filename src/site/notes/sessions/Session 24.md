#sessions
The island flies! :D But it can't move. D: To make it move a search for an expert got started. A certain [[npcs/Wesford related/Professor Archibald\|Professor Archibald]], from the Magical Architecture department of [[locations/buildings/The University Of Arcane Science and Applied Magics\|The University Of Arcane Science and Applied Magics]].

After meeting a familiar face, we set forth to [[locations/cities and towns/SlumberHaven\|SlumberHaven]](not to be confused with [[locations/villages/Slumbering Village\|Slumbering Village]]), a cozy town with a dark secret. To keep the settlement from devastation, blood sacrifices are made. Deep in the sewers diverse and surprisingly tough monsters reside, guarding the sacrifice ritual. By defeating it's guards and interrupting the ritual, Mr Archibald, [[npcs/Carl\|Carl]] and [[npcs/That Other Guy™️\|That Other Guy™️]] are spared from death.
    
Also, [[players/Imp\|Imp]] made an appointment with [[events/The SlumberHaven Sacrifice\|The SlumberHaven Sacrifice]] staff to replace their victim.
