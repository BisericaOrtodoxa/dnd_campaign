#sessions
[[factions/The Party\|The Party]] managed to unfuck themselves, thanks to a demon[[DM ONLY/The Patron\|ยน]]. Thousands of souls in its possession withered away into nothingness to make that possible. Hopefully, that's not gonna turn badly. Managed to save [[players/Leo\|Leo]] and [[players/Imp\|Imp]]. In the midst of literal nothingness, the bard([[npcs/Major NPCS/Seiro\|Seiro]]) watches the party. 

[[sessions/Session 21\|Session 21]] is next.
