# Scrimshaw Mirror

Wondrous item, rare 

This ornate mirror, carved from knucklehead trout ivory, has a peculiar silver surface. While holding this mirror, you can use a bonus action to cause it to animate. 
The mirrorâ€™s surface ripples briefly and you see a faint aura around any reflected creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
Additionally, while the mirror remains animated, you can use an action to cast sending. 
If a reflective surface is within 30 feet of your target, the mirror allows you to see and hear the target as if you had
cast clairvoyance. The mirror regains this ability again at the next dawn.
The mirror remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or the mirror leaves your hand.
