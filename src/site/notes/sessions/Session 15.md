#sessions #incomplete

[[The Obsidian Ball\|The Obsidian Ball]] is also mentioned for the first time in the recaps, although it was obtained in an earlier session.
It shows the players how low their reading comprehension is.

Other than this i don't have a recap for this session.
The adventure continues in [[sessions/Session 16\|Session 16]]
