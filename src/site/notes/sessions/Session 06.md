After boarding a ship to cross from the peninsula (that once belonged to [[locations/countries/Hartombia\|Hartombia]]) to [[locations/cities and towns/Shiford\|Shiford]] (both located in the country of [[locations/countries/Seamersia\|Seamersia]]), the party got attacked by pirates, which were defeated quick.
They debarked at port, exchanged items with an elf merchant.

Strangely, they keep meeting the bard and they didn't question it. They don't know much about them at this point.([[npcs/Other Major NPCS/Seiro\|Seiro]])

Dreamt about some sort of entity rowing a boat with them
