Weapon, *very rare*

This appears to be a large kitchen knife, though it can be wielded exactly like a dagger. 
It resonates faintly with abjuration magic, and is uncomfortable for any fey to touch with their bare skin. It glows faintly when fey creatures are within 120 feet of it, and it deals an extra 1d6 piercing damage when used against them.
The [[npcs/Bastion of the Frost Lord/Briar Knight\|Briar Knight]] has imbued the knife with an additional enchantment. The bearer has advantage on attack rolls against Lord Frost, and the knife does an additional 4d6 radiant damage when it strikes him.
