#sessions 
Things are in full swing now!
The party encounters  2 assassins that failed at their job quite badly. One of them is will be residing in the bag of holding for quite a while.([[npcs/Tortured Capture Assassin\|Tortured Capture Assassin]])

After a quick visit to [[npcs/greyhawk related/The Greyhawk blacksmith - maker of DOGSHIT SWORD 1\|The Greyhawk blacksmith - maker of DOGSHIT SWORD 1]], The impoverished are now armed.  Fueled by the desire to overthrow, they gather and swarm across [[locations/cities and towns/The Free City of Greyhawk(tuah)\|The Free City of Greyhawk(tuah)]], leading to a stampede heading directly to the [[npcs/greyhawk related/The Greyhawk Baron\|The Greyhawk Baron]]'s citadel.  The local authorities scramble to stop the crowd but it does not work.
Using a clever setup, the walls freeze and crumble, allowing for a quick entry into the main courtyard. In a moment of empathy, [[players/Imp\|Imp]] manages to spare the [[npcs/greyhawk related/2 Greyhawk Guards(spared)\|2 Greyhawk Guards(spared)]] standing between him and the main building. Our rogue [[players/Leo\|Leo]] managed to turn invisible, but it hasn't been of use quite yet.
The manor is weirdly lacking in armed personnel, as the party only manages to find scared workers inside.
The air is filled with change.

Miscellaneous events:
the death of an [[npcs/apple salesman\|apple salesman]], imp being hungry i guess
[[npcs/greyhawk related/2 greyhawk alleyway guards\|2 greyhawk alleyway guards]] died at the exact same alleyway as last time
[[npcs/Man carry box\|Man carry box]] rising out of nowhere and absolutely wrecking stuff up with the boxes he was indeed carrying
[[players/Imp\|Imp]] almost drowning again while crossing the river on well built and very safe bridges.

The adventure continues in [[sessions/Session 11\|Session 11]]
