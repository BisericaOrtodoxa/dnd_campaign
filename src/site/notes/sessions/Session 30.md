#sessions

After [[npcs/Carl\|Carl]] recovered in the barracks, he becomes a new man. He is handsome now. In order for permanent lodging at the flying bastion, he shares a quest opportunity with the party.

Said party has a new(old) member! [[players/Emery\|Emery]] The Resurrected. 

Upon probing into the situation, they find a beggar named [[DM ONLY/Casyn\|Casyn]] at a local tavern near the permafrost region. Got their generous donation of 5 gold, he recites a poem and bestows to [[factions/The party\|The party]] specialized weapon([[items/items/Frostbane\|Frostbane]]). 

His poem reads so:
"THE Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,
And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height,
In silence I'll take my way:
I will not go on with that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,
But I'll be as busy as they."
Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its crest;
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed
In diamond beads and over the breast
Of the quivering lake he spread
A coat of mail, that it need not fear
The downward point of many a spear
That hung on its margin far and near,
Where a rock could rear its head.
He went to the windows of those who slept,
And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things-there were flowers and trees;
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees;
There were cities with temples and towers, and these
All pictured in silver sheen!
But he did one thing that was hardly fair;
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
That all had forgotten for him to prepare
"Now just to set them a-thinking,
I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,
"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,
And the glass of water they've left for me
Shall 'tchick!' to tell them I'm drinking."

Soon after( in-between squabbling about gambling addiction) a mechanical bee shatters the window of the tavern, and delivers a message containing a call to action. A local is looking for help finding his lost daughter. His name is [[DM ONLY/Orin Farlight\|Orin Farlight]], and his missing daughter is named [[npcs/Bastion of the Frost Lord/Belma Farlight\|Belma Farlight]]. Upon looking into it further and playing hide and seek with the other sister, [[npcs/Bastion of the Frost Lord/Aramila Farlight\|Aramila Farlight]], the party receives the [[items/items/Scrimshaw Mirror\|Scrimshaw Mirror]] and heads off to Lord Frost's residence.
    
On the way there [[factions/The party\|The party]] encounters a [[locations/villages/Goblin village\|Goblin village]], buys an [[items/ivory flute\|ivory flute]] and a [[items/items/Ring of Naked Invisibility\|Ring of Naked Invisibility]].
    
[[players/Emery\|Emery]](played by melon from this session onward) tries and fails to rob a dysfunctional goblin household, gets the father killed and then sells the entire settlement using the [[items/items/Portable Gambling Machine\|Portable Gambling Machine]] obtained from [[npcs/Mr. Loan\|Mr. Loan]]. To stop his self destructive behavior [[players/Remy\|Remy]] tries to sell the machine and it simply vanishes.

[[DM ONLY/The Iron Piglet\|The Iron Piglet]] also joined the party as a guide to find the missing person.
