# Frostweaver Amulet

This enchanted amulet is a small, intricately crafted crystal suspended from a delicate silver chain. When activated with a simple incantation, the Frostweaver Amulet allows its wearer to freeze water within sight. The effect is temporary, lasting only a few minutes, and is perfect for creating makeshift bridges, barriers, or distractions.![Pasted image 20250913174538.png](/img/user/items/tome%20pages/image%20files/Pasted%20image%2020250913174538.png)
