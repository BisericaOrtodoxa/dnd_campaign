#sessions
Gambling has been a disaster for our players finances.

Using one of the rewards for wining the tournament from [[sessions/Session 26\|session 26]], [[factions/The party\|The party]] tracks down [[locations/buildings/Karlov Manor\|Karlov Manor]] and retrieves [[DM ONLY/Reality Fracture\|a strange bend in reality that they decide to call "the artifact"]].

Checkered constructs attempt to retrieve the [[DM ONLY/Reality Fracture\|artifact]]. The situation was defused via talking.
[[npcs/Carl\|Carl]]'s mission was put on hold to see what the constructs want with the artifact.

Next Session: [[sessions/Session 28\|Session 28]]
