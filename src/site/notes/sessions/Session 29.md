Written by BNN with DM changes by Araki

[[factions/The Party\|The Party]] went to [[npcs/Major NPCS/The Witch\|The Witch]]'s house to complete the ritual to free [[npcs/Flying bastion residents/Carl\|Carl]] from being a familiar, but she was not there so they proceeded to jump through some hoops(beans means [[locations/buildings/The Path of The Sage\|The Path of The Sage]]) and reach the designated ritual point™.

After Carl botched the ritual, the bard ([[npcs/Major NPCS/Seiro\|Seiro]]) appeared and stole the magical crack[[DM ONLY/Reality Fracture\|¹]] in the space-time and and then left.
[[npcs/Flying bastion residents/Carl\|Carl]] is no longer a familiar, but he was left in a bad state so [[players/Remy\|Remy]] put him in a medically induced coma to recover, very gently.

On the way back [[players/Imp\|Imp]], after beating himself up, managed to seduce a chest into opening and giving him a true resurrection. He proceeded to revive his old friend [[players/Emery\|Emery]], then almost killed him, then he got saved by [[players/Gorich\|Gorich]] and [[players/Imp\|Imp]] tried to kill him again but got put to sleep by [[npcs/Major NPCS/Druid The Squirrel\|Druid The Squirrel]]. After which Emery proceeded to leave with Druid(who the party presumes to be a traitor due to a past book note).
This will certainly not backfire in any way.

[[players/Gorich\|Gorich]] summoned a cute familiar fox and [[players/Remy\|Remy]] went to a forest from imp's dark past to get himself a wolf - [[npcs/Erry Family/Larry\|Larry]]

__ 
"On top of this I'll leave you with some questions to ponder: 
Why did the witch have such a strong spell on hand? How pissed will she be that it's missing?

. 
What might Emery do now that he knows Imp wants him dead? Just who might he ally himself with? And now that he's resurrected, is he truly back in the same state he was in before?" - Araki
