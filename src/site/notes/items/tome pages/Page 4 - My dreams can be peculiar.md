The other night i had a strage dream. I dreamt of a place i scarecly return to. It was a cold day in a village i spent time living with my grandma when i was little. I'd like to return to days like those. Simpler days. I remember it vividly, a strange existance burrowing its way into me. I just knew wat it was. A malignant spirit, a fiend. Strange at it seems, i was not afraid. This unnatural state i found myself in felt stable. It didnt utter a word yet i understood everything it said. Its presence was inconsequential yet i felt its weight.
