# Session 17

[[items/items/The Deck of Many Things\|The Deck of Many Things]] and its hilarious consequences.
Cards rolled(BNN/[[players/Emery\|Emery]]): 
Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
Donjon You are spatially displaced and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You draw no more cards. (edited)

Cards rolled([[players/Leo\|Leo]]/Demon):
KEY
A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.
Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.
