Post Session:
As you last slept, a dream becomes clear to you. The visage of a grand cathedral surrounds you. There's no sermon, no people, just darkness.
And from the darkness, light was born
Only it was not the light of the lord
As the light hits your eyes you see an unfamiliar figure standing in front of you with an amused grin.

[[npcs/The Patron\|¹]]
    
    My, my… look at you. So valiant. So doomed. All that effort, all that blood spilled — and still, here you are, one step from ruin. You've gathered curse after curse, youve got death hanging behind you. And most importantly, you've made a powerful enemy you cant even comprehend yet.I could _change_ that. "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?" By sheer incompetence you've tipped the scales of fate so far against you I can hardly believe it. But i come offering a deal. A dim light, in the pit you've dug under yourselves. By my authority, granted by ■■■■ himself, I could simply push the scales in the other direction. A clean slate( or as clean as you lot can get). A second chance. And in return, I ask only for a gift. Not your soul, I have more of those than I know what to do with. No, I want something far more interesting: your greatest weapon. The object of your greed and foolishness that _got you here to begin with_. Give that to me, and I will give you everything else. So… what will it be? Prepare an answer, as i will be seeing you soon. And do keep an eye out, you've been watched since the beginning

This deal ends up being taken in [[sessions/Session 20\|Session 20]] because [[factions/The party\|The party]] is objectively too stupid to not shoot themselves in the foot via [[items/items/The Deck of Many Things\|The Deck of Many Things]]. It was their own choice.
