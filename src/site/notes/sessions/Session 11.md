Following up on last time, 
Almost the entire [[npcs/greyhawk related/The Greyhawk Baron\|The Greyhawk Baron]] manor got explored. Any sort of smart play or stealth got destroyed by imp being his true self. 

Following some chatter, the party attacked the baron(no name given). After a long and hard battle window escape was attempted. Things were looking dire as no amount of floating, self defenestration or duck transformation was seemingly enough to catch him.

Just as he was about to escape, The Baron was met by the sheer, immovable aura of [[npcs/Man carry box\|Man carry box]], who managed to stop the Baron in place by casting a spell on him with his Staff. The crowd of the revolutionaries attacked the Baron, leading to his death. Nothing but a naked corpse remains.
