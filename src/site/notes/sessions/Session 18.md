# Session 18

4/20/25

The party hurries to rescue [[players/Emery\|Emery]]. Which vanished due to drawing a cards from [[items/items/The Deck of Many Things\|The Deck of Many Things]].
They also drew many many cards 
<u>Skull. </u>
An Avatar of Death appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another [[DM ONLY/creatures of all kinds/divinity/Avatar of Death\|Avatar of Death]]. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks.(neutralized temporarily) Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t count as one of your declared draws.(active)

<u>Flames.</u>
A powerful [[creatures/Devil\|devil]] becomes your enemy. The [[creatures/Devil\|devil]] seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.(twice) Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.(effect applied) Gem.fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet. 

<u>Throne.</u> 
You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.(applied)

[[spells/Wish\|Wish]] was cast 2 times also! one resulted in another wish, the other made BNN able to convince anyone of anything for 5 days(the effects end after those 5 days)
    
The effects of the wish spells are also like this : The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
    
so far bnn/[[players/Emery\|Emery]] passed the 33% 2 times in a row!(but i rolled it privately)

Also, shoutouts to Rene Descartes for helping [[players/Imp\|Imp]] realize that he himself exists, _no matter what_.(Somewhat related to [[DM ONLY/concepts/meta-existence\|¹]])
If he rolled he didn't exist, he would've been able to debate the idea.
[[npcs/Flying bastion residents/Man carry box\|Man carry box]] was also able to beat _an_ [[DM ONLY/creatures of all kinds/divinity/Avatar of Death\|Avatar of Death]] in a fiddle duel.
You also came to know he's from "[[locations/regions/Georgia\|Georgia]]". Whatever that is

Notably, a huge flame dragon was guarding the entrance to the Warden Dungeon. Upon attacking it directly via melee, it turns out it was just [[npcs/Rat Brothers/Ratthew\|Ratthew]], an incredibly durable rat.

The [[npcs/Flying bastion residents/Slime Woman\|Slime Woman]] was also first encountered in this session.

New Glyphs: [[items/tome pages/glyph related/Sense Glyph\|Sense Glyph]], [[items/tome pages/glyph related/Delay Glyph\|Delay Glyph]](tho initially the function of it was unknown)
