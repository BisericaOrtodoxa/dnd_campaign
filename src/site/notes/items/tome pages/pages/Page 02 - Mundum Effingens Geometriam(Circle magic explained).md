Mundum Effingens Geometriam

In days of yore, enchantments were woven upon the world through geometric forms and runes, each depicting fundamental magical precepts. These assemblages of shapes are oft named "Magic Circles." Though ancient, their use remains worthy of contemplation, for they permit even the uninitiated to wield their power, provided the preparations are meticulously followed.

Therefore, my devoted disciples, I impart unto thee this venerable lore: The Mundum Effingens Geometriam.

The elements of this sacred art of magic circle creation are thus delineated: The core, the magic symbols, and the lines themselves (which are commonly circular in form). The lines signify the linkage amongst all elements of the circle; bereft of them, a magic circle cannot subsist. The core signifies the central concept or object of the incantation at hand. The symbols constitute the ultimate embodiment of the magical energy's form during the spell. These may encompass tangible entities, such as earth, or more ethereal notions like "addition" or "spin."

Magic circles are to be created and read from the core concept in the center, then moving up towards the first circle line, then read clockwise then moving up to the next circle(if it exists) and so on.
To illustrate this, let us consider the following example:

In this particular case,  the central concept is read first( wkich is "space"),  then we move to  the upmost symbol( "place"), then we trace along the circle in a clockwise motion, arriving at the last symbol(which is light). Upon reading the symbols in the correct order, we can conclude that it's purpose is to place light to illuminate an area.
