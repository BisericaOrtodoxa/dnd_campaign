#sessions
The party managed to come across something called "[[locations/buildings/The Forgive or Forget Parlor\|The Forgive or Forget Parlor]]". A revolutionary program that is meant to help people with memory related trauma.(at least that's what the people there were saying). 
Curiously, an old person([[npcs/greyhawk related/Forgive Forget Pacient\|Forgive Forget Pacient]]) that got out from that establishment forgot most of their life. The party dutifully alerted the staff of the parlor and they seem to have begun taking action. Was this a good choice? Maybe this building hides more than what is observed on the surface... Or maybe not, who knows? There are more pressing issues at hand anyhow.

In their attempts to move about [[locations/cities and towns/The Free City of Greyhawk(tuah)\|The Free City of Greyhawk(tuah)]] the group almost got one dwarf I wont name arrested([[players/Imp\|Imp]]). Fortunately, due to comedic shenanigans, no blood was spilled.

Things don't seem to be going well in the city of Greyhawk(tuah?), socio-economically. The poor remain impoverished while the people at the top grow wealthier. A tale as old as time. The most emblematic of this upper class is [[npcs/greyhawk related/The Greyhawk Baron\|The Greyhawk Baron]], ruler of this great city.
In an attempt to escape fate, our 3 comedically inclined characters decided to overthrow this ruler seemingly guided by greed by causing an insurrection. 

The time of conflict draws near.  The air is crackling with rebellion.
