# Session 25

[[factions/The Party\|The Party]] heard from the sewer cult that there was a god that needed appeasement (hence [[events/The SlumberHaven Sacrifice\|The SlumberHaven Sacrifice]]) so they went to confront it in a volcano. 
At the start, they went over the canyon with some rope and almost died like 3 times inside the dungeon. There was a spider that either turned invisible or walked through a different dimension. 
The "god" was a fire elemental that we didn't even have to fight.
In their search for the arcane mechanism(needed for [[locations/buildings/The Flying Bastion\|The Flying Bastion]]), [[players/Emery\|Emery]] and [[players/Leo\|Leo]] died on the field of battle against some incredibly [[npcs/Misc/ferocious canyon dwellers\|ferocious canyon dwellers]].
Had they taken the rope path again, they would have been safe. Not every fight has to be fought.
