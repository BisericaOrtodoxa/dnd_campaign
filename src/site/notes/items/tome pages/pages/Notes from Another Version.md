#tome_pages
Only tangible evidence so far about [[DM ONLY/concepts/Parallel Universes\|ยน]]

note 1:
The party was tasked with eradicating the source of the poisoned river in Alterham
They decided to follow the river to find out the source of said poison
The journey was quite long so they stopped and camped along the way
In his half aware meditation state, Tre managed to notice that the party was being watched from afar
Then they decided to act like lunatics basically and the guy watching them got spooked
They followed him and came upon this:
A settlement built by a cult
Tre managed to act poor and get himself accepted into the cult
Moondawg kills 2 people and manages to disguise himself as one of them
Melon also gets accepted into the cult
As their initiation, tre and million  stepped on this here circle that was drawn onto the ground
And said the oath
They now have the mark(maybe cursed maybe not hehe) of the frozen god on their shoulders
As a celebration, everyone got drunk
While the cult was drunk, they killed everyone besides their leader
Their leader was the only one that was not black out drunk
They tried attacking him.And got blasted by pure magic energy.
The party defeats the lader and gains some freeze realted boons

note 2: 
I pledge my unwavering loyalty to the Frozen God, to serve with reverence and devotion, honoring the icy slumber that sustains our world. I vow to keep sacred the secrets of Frostfell, guarding our rituals, knowledge, and artifacts from the profane eyes of outsiders, preserving the sanctity of our mission. I dedicate myself to the pursuit of freezing tranquility, seeking to spread our lodrship's influence to bring about a world encased in serene frost, shielding it from chaos and strife. I accept the burden of duty, offering precious offerings and unwavering obedience to advance the frozen destiny we envision for this realm. I relinquish personal desires for the greater glory, committing to the chilling path laid forth by our revered deity. May our lord's frozen embrace guide my actions, and may the eternal ice preserve and purify our existence until the world stands tranquil and frozen in divine perfection.
