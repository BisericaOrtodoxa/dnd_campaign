"I cannot begin to state how important this is, what really are you, and what are you doing to us?  to all of us? focus on your past. do you really have one? did you conveniently forget? is it starting to fade it? is it clear and concise?
What was your favorite food as a child? you don't know, do you. think about it more and its gonna come to you, but not because you remember. this is what you're doing to everyone. From the bottom of my heart i beg you, stop. Lay down, rest, cease. its not as bad as you think. 
PLEASE ERASE YOURSELVES"
