In abosulute secrecy, cloaked in the glistening embrace of frost, the devout gather to partake in the sacred Frostbound Communion. 
Enrobed in vestments woven from threads touched by the breath of winter, they approach the frost-bitten altar bearing offerings of frozen water, 
shining gold and gems, and a sacrifice of the flesh. The ritual space is sanctified by inscribed circles, bearing symbols that echo the elemental resonance of their worship.

_Prayer to Shin'Nai_([[npcs/Divinity/The Frozen God\|ยน]]): 

Frost that binds, Ice that shapes, In your chilling aura, our faith awakes. From the realm of endless cold, Your worshipers, in reverence, unfold. O Frozen Deity, sovereign and divine, In icy realms, where frost intertwines. From the depths of your crystalline throne, Hear our voices, as they intone. Glacial sovereign, hear our plea, Master of the wintry decree. In your presence, we humbly stand, Enveloped in the frost, at your command. We offer treasures, true and pure, Sacred symbols that shall endure. Accept our gifts, woven with devotion, Sustain us in the arctic ocean. Grant us visions, glimpses cold, Secrets of the future, yet untold. Illuminate the path with frozen light, Guide us through the eternal night. As the snowflakes dance in the moonlit air, Bless us, with your frigid care. In your icy embrace, may we find grace, For we are yours, bound to wintry space.
