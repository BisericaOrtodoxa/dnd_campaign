# Session 12

Today was definitely the quiet that follows after the storm. 
The party gave one more look to the ex-baron's mansion after recovering their [[items/items/Immovable Rod\|Immovable Rod]].
We also saw even more of [[npcs/Erry Family/Jerry\|Jerry]]'s family. I can't help but point out that every time we meet them, something else seems to be going on in the distance.
[[npcs/Greyhawk related/The Greyhawk blacksmith - maker of DOGSHIT SWORD 1\|The Greyhawk blacksmith - maker of DOGSHIT SWORD 1]] was gone too. His shop trashed. 
And the oh so familiar [[npcs/Misc/Donkey eater merchant\|Donkey eater merchant]] gave some items to the party. He's doing better now since he could afford to replace his donkey.(Rip donkey)
Upon travelling to [[locations/cities and towns/Westford\|Westford]], [[factions/The Party\|The Party]] wanders in an autumnal forest . Home to a snazzy little tea shop.([[locations/buildings/Wanderstop TeaShop\|¹]])
Here we meet [[DM ONLY/creatures of all kinds/npcs/Wanderstop/Josephine\|Josephine]], a famous fighter who can't pick up her sword anymore (None of the players heard of her ever). 
What's more interesting is that space seems to be inconsistent for this forest, as you meet [[npcs/Flying bastion residents/Carl\|Carl]]  and The Bard™️(didn't ask for name, but it is [[npcs/Other Major NPCS/Seiro\|Seiro]]) despite them being far far away from the party.

I feel it imperative to point out how a lot of the things [[DM ONLY/creatures of all kinds/npcs/Wanderstop/Josephine\|Josephine]] was saying make no sense to you, like the cultists doing community work and the acceptance towards other creature races.

There was also the tea, brewed from fruits never before seen. And tasting like concepts(and raspberries) 
or was it strawberry?

Notes:
Shoutouts to [[players/Emery\|Emery]](bnn) for getting [[DM ONLY/creatures of all kinds/npcs/Wanderstop/Josephine\|Josephine]]'s issue spot on, it was indeed a mental issue.
Also, don't feel down that you couldn't do anything about it, you weren't exactly meant to. Not every place is meant to exist for you to "solve"
