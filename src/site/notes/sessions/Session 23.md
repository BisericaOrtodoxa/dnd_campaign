#sessions
As [[factions/The Party\|The Party]] arrives to their destination, they realize the culmination of time passing while they were gone. The streets look slightly different, the ever so present kingdom flags that were hanging everywhere changed. And they are flying at half mast. But tour goal does not change. Above them hangs a floating island, crumbling and old.
As [[factions/The Party\|The Party]] approaches the entranced gate, the guards recognize them. Without skipping a beat they point towards someone, by king's decree. In what seems to be a small building, a chubby yet stern looking man meets you([[npcs/Wesford related/Seamersian Architect\|Seamersian Architect]]). It turns out nobody had the money to renovate the island, so the contractor stands in front of them for that exact reason. Although certain parts of the party's architectural preferences are avant-garde, they manage to convey the vision.

Partly due to increased funding, the building process is rather fast paced. But time passes, and you find yourself alone in your finished outpost. As the sun sets, you turn back to rest for once filled with satisfaction.
As each person enters their rooms,  something out of the ordinary is found.

On all of your nightstands, identical knives rest. On the walls behind them red writing lies. "It's never too late"
The knives are thin with striking black and white handles and unreasonably sharp. Even to the untrained eyes, its obvious. They are meant to cut. _Once_
