#sessions #incomplete
This session is also poorly documented on my end.

This is the first mention of [[items/items/The Deck of Many Things\|The Deck of Many Things]]. it causes horrific events that eventually lead to the wiping out of [[factions/The Crystal Frost Cult\|the frozen cult]](tho i don't think that happens in this exact session)

Book pages: [[items/tome pages/Page(s) 9 - First Puzzle\|Page(s) 9 - First Puzzle]]

The adventure continues in [[sessions/Session 15\|Session 15]]
